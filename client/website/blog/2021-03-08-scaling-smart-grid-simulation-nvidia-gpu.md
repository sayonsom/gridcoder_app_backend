Writing CUDA C++ applications that efficiently and correctly utilize all available GPUs on a node drastically improves performance over single-GPU code, and makes the most cost-effective use out of compute nodes with multiple GPUs. In this workshop you will learn to utilize multiple GPUs on a single node by:

Learning how to launch kernels on multiple GPUs, each working on a subsection of the required work
Learning how to use concurrent CUDA Streams to overlap memory copy with computation on multiple GPUs
Upon completion, you will be able to build robust and efficient CUDA C++ applications that can leverage all available GPUs on a single node."
